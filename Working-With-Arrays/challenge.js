// Coding Challenge #1

// Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog owners about their dog's age, and stored the data into an array (one array for each). For now, they are just interested in knowing whether a dog is an adult or a puppy. A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years old, and it's a puppy if it's less than 3 years old.

// Create a function 'checkDogs', which accepts 2 arrays of dog's ages ('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate'), and does the following things:

// 1. Julia found out that the owners of the FIRST and the LAST TWO dogs actually have cats, not dogs! So create a shallow copy of Julia's array, and remove the cat ages from that copied array (because it's a bad practice to mutate function parameters)
// 2. Create an array with both Julia's (corrected) and Kate's data
// 3. For each remaining dog, log to the console whether it's an adult ("Dog number 1 is an adult, and is 5 years old") or a puppy ("Dog number 2 is still a puppy üê∂")
// 4. Run the function for both test datasets

// HINT: Use tools from all lectures in this section so far üòâ

// TEST DATA 1: Julia's data [3, 5, 2, 12, 7], Kate's data [4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
// TEST DATA 2: Julia's data [9, 16, 6, 8, 3], Kate's data [10, 5, 6, 1, 4]

// GOOD LUCK üòÄ

const dataJulia = [3, 5, 2, 12, 7];
const dataKate = [4, 1, 15, 8, 3];

const checkDogs = function (dogsJulia, dogsKate) {
  const dogsOnly = dogsJulia.slice(1, -2);
  console.log(dogsOnly);
  let newData = [...dogsOnly, ...dogsKate];
  console.log(newData);
  newData.forEach(function (age, i) {
    // console.log(age);
    let result =
      age >= 3
        ? ` Dog number ${i + 1} is an adult, and is ${age} years old`
        : ` Dog number ${i + 1} is still a puppy üê∂`;
    console.log(result);
  });
};

checkDogs(dataJulia, dataKate);
console.log("----DATA 2 ----");
checkDogs([9, 16, 6, 8, 3], [10, 5, 6, 1, 4]);

// JONAS'

const checkDogsAge = function (dogsJulia, dogsKate) {
  const dogsJuliaCorrected = dogsJulia.slice(); // he didn't mutate directly here, he created a shallow copy with slice
  dogsJuliaCorrected.splice(0, 1);
  dogsJuliaCorrected.splice(-2);
  // dogsJulia.slice(1, 3);
  const dogs = dogsJuliaCorrected.concat(dogsKate);
  console.log(dogs);

  dogs.forEach(function (dog, i) {
    if (dog >= 3) {
      console.log(`Dog number ${i + 1} is an adult, and is ${dog} years old`);
    } else {

    }

// Coding Challenge #2

// Let's go back to Julia and Kate's study about dogs. This time, they want to convert dog ages to human ages and calculate the average age of the dogs in their study.

// Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge', which accepts an arrays of dog's ages ('ages'), and does the following things in order:

// 1. Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula: if the dog is <= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge. If the dog is > 2 years old, humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4.
// TEST DATA 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]
// 2. Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old (which is the same as keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old)
// 3. Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs (you should already know from other challenges how we calculate averages üòâ)
// 4. Run the function for both test datasets

// TEST DATA 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]

const calcAverageHumanAge = function (ages) {
  // const humanAge = ages.map(function (currDogAge) {
  //   if (currDogAge <= 2) {
  //     return 2 * currDogAge;
  //   }
  //    else if (currDogAge > 2) {
  //     return 16 + currDogAge * 4;
  //   }
  // });
  // return humanAge;

  const humanAge = ages.map((currDogAge) =>
    currDogAge <= 2 ? 2 * currDogAge : 16 + currDogAge * 4
  );
  const adults = humanAge.filter((age) => age >= 18);
  console.log(humanAge);
  console.log(adults);

  // const average = adults.reduce((acc, age) => acc + age, 0) / adults.length;

  const average = adults.reduce(
    (acc, curr, i, arr) => acc + curr / arr.length,
    0
  );
  // 2 3. (2+3)/2 = 2.5 === 2/2+3/2 = 2.5

  return average;
};

const data1 = calcAverageHumanAge([5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]);
console.log(data1);
const data2 = calcAverageHumanAge([16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]);
console.log(data2);

///////////////////////////////////////
// Coding Challenge #3

// Rewrite the 'calcAverageHumanAge' function from the previous challenge, but this time as an arrow function, and using chaining!

// TEST DATA 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
// TEST DATA 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]

// GOOD LUCK üòÄ

const calcAverageHumanAgeArr = (ages) => {
  return ages
    .map((dogAge) => (dogAge <= 2 ? 2 * dogAge : 16 + dogAge * 4))
    .filter((age) => age >= 18)
    .reduce((acc, curr, i, arr) => acc + curr / arr.length, 0);
  // Now what's really important to notice here, is that this is actually really the only way of calculating the average now. So basically dividing the age by the length of the current array immediately here in each of the iteration. So remember that in the last challenge, I first simply added all the values together. And then afterwards I divided it by the length of the array.

  // So in this case, by the length of the adults array.  However, that would not work in this case.  Because there would be no way of knowing the length  of the adults array.
};

console.log("-------USING MULTIPLE CHAINING ------");
console.log(calcAverageHumanAgeArr([5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]));
console.log(calcAverageHumanAgeArr([16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]));
